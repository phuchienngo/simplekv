# Simple in-memory key-value database

## How to run
- Install [Bazelisk](https://bazel.build/install/bazelisk)
- Run: `bazel run //app:main_app -- -p 11211 -n simplekv -w 2 -s 4`
    - p: port number
    - n: server name
    - w: number of worker threads
    - s: number of selector threads
## Features
- [MemCached Binary Protocol](https://docs.memcached.org/protocols/binary/) support
- I/O Multiplexing
- Key-based data partitioning with Consistent hashing for lock-free parallel processing
- LMAX Disruptor for efficient thread communication
- Custom memory management with Buddy Allocation algorithm:
  - Reducing OS overhead on frequent dynamic memory allocation
  - O(h) allocation and deallocation complexity (where h is the height of the tree, equal to logâ‚‚(maxBlockSize/minBlockSize))
  - Using array-based complete binary tree for efficient memory block management
- Graceful shutdown
- Swiss table data structure
- Bazel build system for simplified development environment
